* odk_logger - This app serves XForms to ODK Collect and receives
  submissions from ODK Collect. This is a stand alone application.

  csv and xls export of the data stored in odk_logger. This app uses a
  data dictionary as produced by pyxform. It also provides a map and
  single survey view.

  together.
